# Contributing to Parse SDK for .NET

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests. When we get one, we'll run some tests on it first. From here, we'll need to get a core member to sign off on the changes and then merge the pull request.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Add unit tests for any new code you add.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.

## Style Guide

We're still working on providing a more concise code style for your IDE and getting a linter on GitHub, but for now try to keep the following:

* We use [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org) to manage basic editor settings, please install a compatible plugin for your preferred environment.
* Most importantly, match the existing code style as much as possible.
* Try to keep lines under 120 characters, if possible.
